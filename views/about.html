        Childhood and family
Further information: Musk family
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of South Africa,[7][8] and was baptized into an Anglican church.[9] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[10][11] His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada and raised in South Africa.[12][13][14] His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[15][16] Musk has a younger brother Kimbal (born 1972) and a younger sister Tosca (born 1974).[14][17]

Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia.[18][19][20] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father.[10] Musk later regretted his decision as he has become estranged from his father.[21] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[18][22]

In his biography, Ashlee Vance described Musk as an awkward and introverted child.[23] When Musk was 10, he developed an interest in computing and video games, so he brought a Commodore VIC-20[24][vague] and taught himself programming from an user manual. At age 12, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[25][26]

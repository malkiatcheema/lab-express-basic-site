Later in 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri borrowed funds from Musk's father and founded Zip2.[21] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[41] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[42] with Musk coding the website in every night.[42] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[43][unreliable source?] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch,[44] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO himself were thwarted.[45] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[46][47] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[48]

X.com and PayPal

Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[49] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks and over 200,000 customers joined after its initial months of operation.[50] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[51]

In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition[42][51][52] as Confinity's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[53] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees and Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to resign.[54] In addition to compounding technological issues and a lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[55][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money transfer service and renamed as PayPal in 2001.[57][58]

The next year, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[59][60] More than one and a half decades later, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal in 2017 because of his personal sentimental value.[61][62]

SpaceX

In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[63] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[64] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[64] With $100 million of his early fortune,[65] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[66][67]

SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[68] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[69]) Mike Griffin later that year.[70][71] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to bankrupt,[68] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[72] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[73] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[74] Musk credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the company.[75]

Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.[76] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[77] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[78][79] Since 2019,[80] SpaceX is developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Heavy.[81] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[82]

SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[83] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[84] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[85][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat for spacecraft.[88][89][90] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink systems to Ukraine to provide internet access and communication,[91] an action praised by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[92][93] However, he refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech absolutist."[94][95]

Tesla

Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[96] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[97] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[98][99] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[100]

Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[101][102] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[103] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[104][105] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[106] In 2021 Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.[107]

Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[108] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[109] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[110][111] A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[112][113] The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[114][115] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[116] The Cybertruck—an all-electric pickup truck—was unveiled in 2019.[117] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada,[118] Gigafactory 2 in New York,[119] Gigafactory 3 in China,[120] Gigafactory 4 in Germany,[121] and Gigafactory 5 in Texas.[122]

Since its initial public offering in 2010,[123] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[124][125] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[126][127] In October 2021 it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in US history.[128] On November 6, 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".[129] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in the week ending November 12,[129] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[130] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[131]

SEC lawsuit
In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[132][133][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[133][137][138] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[139][140]

Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[141][142] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[143] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[144] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[145] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[146][147] FOIA released records showing that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".[148]
